  OpenViewed Tabs Chrome Extension
</h1>

**OpenedViewed Tabs** is a lightweight Chrome extension that helps you visually track which tabs you’ve actually looked at — and which ones are still waiting for your attention.

🆕 Ever open multiple links in new tabs and forget which ones you already checked?  

👀 This extension makes unviewed tabs **bold**, so you instantly know what’s new.

---

## ✨ How It Works

- 🖱️ When you **open a link in a new tab**, its tab title will appear **bold**.

- ✅ Once you **view the tab**, the title returns to normal font weight.

- 📌 This gives you a **quick visual overview** of what you’ve seen vs. not yet viewed.

### 🖼️ Example

Here’s what it looks like in action:

![Example of tab titles showing bold and normal states](https://github.com/Yael-F/open-viewed-tabs/blob/main/assets/example_chrome_tabs.PNG)

- Tabs in **bold** = not yet viewed  
- Tabs in normal font = already viewed

> Simple. Clean. Super helpful when multitasking or researching.

## 🛠️ Developer Notes

This extension doesn't track history, doesn't require permissions beyond tabs, and keeps everything local. No data is stored or sent anywhere.
